# Biome Configuration for Tests

# Test files may use certain patterns that are flagged by linters but are acceptable in tests:
# - Inline regex patterns for readability
# - Skipped tests for WIP features
# - Disabled rules for test-specific code

# To suppress warnings in test files, add:
# biome-ignore lint/performance/useTopLevelRegex: Test readability

# Or configure .editorconfig or biome.jsonc to be more lenient with test files
